Alexander Köb's Amacube project all shaken up. (https://github.com/akoeb/amacube)


State of Affairs
=============

Sept 27, 2014:
This project is based off of an earlier snapshot of Alexander Köb's Amacube project.  I have broken the project into 3 seperate plugins (quarantine, policy, and wb_list).

This repository should be considered "rough" as there are many bits to be cleaned up and remnants of legacy code exist everywhere.

Other work has been demanding more of my attention lately, but I intend to add LDAP functionality at a later date.  In the mean time, I have made progress on the UI and wanted to make it available to anyone interested.
