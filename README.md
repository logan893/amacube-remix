amacube-remix
=============

Alexander Köb's Amacube project all shaken up. (https://github.com/akoeb/amacube)


State of Affairs
=============

March 19, 2015:
This project is based off of an earlier snapshot of Alexander Köb's Amacube project.  I have broken the project into 3 seperate plugins (quarantine, policy, and wb_list).

This set of plugins is becoming more complete and I using it in production.


Future Thoughts
- Add a "Message Preview" modal box to the quarantine
- Add support to train SA-Bayes filter when items are purged from the quarantine
